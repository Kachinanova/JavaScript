			<h1>Art</h1>
			<p>One of my favorite things to pass the time is to tinker with the creative arts. If I'm not working on a project, chances are I'm reading about new techniques to try out. Some of my current interests are drawing, painting, and learning basic 3D modeling.

			<h1>Wood Journals</h1>
			<p>I also enjoy making old style wooden journals. I make them ahead of time and once someone has chosen the book they like, I burn the image or text of their choice by hand. I plan to begin making my own artistic furnature and decor in the near future.

			<h1>Activities</h1>
			<p>I've recently decided take control of my health and explore the area around me. Hiking local trails, bicycleing around the city, and learning to run are among the ways I'm getting out and about. I've finished two 5k's and once I'm confident in my ability to run start to finish, I plan to move up to the 10k's. Perhaps one day I'll even do a full marathon.
